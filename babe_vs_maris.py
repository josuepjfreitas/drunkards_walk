# [1] According to Leonard Mlodinow's Drunkard's Walk book (Chapter 1), Maris had a stat in 1960 season of 1 HR in 14.7 (or 10 in 147). Using this value here to
#     check how hard is for him to beat Babe Ruth record.  
# [2] The number 698 represent the number o chances to hit a HR that Maris had in 1961 season and it was taken from https://sigmazone.com/quantum_xl_multiple_inputs/
#     because I don't know enough of baseball to do it myself. 

# Final Comment: While both Mlodinow and Philip Mayfield from Sigmazone reached similar results of Maris broking Babe Ruth record once every ~32 seasons, my code reached
#                once every ~35 seasons (due randomness and method, probably), which I believe it's good enough for sharing it in my github. :) 
#                On purpose, I let the round(...,2) in the last printed line instead of rounding it down when it's like 35.2 or up when it's 35.6, everybody that reach 
#                here will be able to correct interpreted that.
